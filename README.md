## 📘 Project Description  
<p align="justify">
This project presents an <b>Excel based dashboard</b> analyzing car sales performance across the United States for the years <b>2022–2023</b>. The dataset includes detailed information such as car models, colors, body styles, engine types, transmission, buyer demographics, and regional sales data. The dashboard provides an <b>interactive view of sales trends, pricing patterns, and market distribution</b> that helping to uncover insights into consumer preferences and vehicle performance across different categories. This analysis demonstrates how raw automotive sales data can be transformed into a clean, visual, and decision-oriented Excel dashboard. Through this project, I practiced transforming and visualizing large datasets using <b>Excel pivot tables</b>, <b>interactive slicers</b>, and <b>dynamic KPI indicators</b> to build a comprehensive business intelligence tool.
